<p>Claire Boucher is a Canadian electronic music artist who is known for her experimental style and D.I.Y. approach to music and art. While she attended McGill University studying neuroscience, she began performing under her stage name, Grimes. Ultimately, she was expelled from the university for missing class to often. Luckily, Grimes became a serious endeavor that would lead to her success as a musician. Since 2010 she has released four albums and one collaboration album. Her album, <em>Visions</em> (2012), was her first album to receive recognition among many music publications. Her musical style has been described as “witch house,” dream pop, art pop, electro-R&B, and “dark wave.”</p>
